# üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è OptoAPI: Depth & 3D Tools for Optometry

**OptoAPI** is a lightweight web API designed to support core optometry applications such as:
- **Depth estimation**
- **Stereo trajectory visualization**
- **3D scene reconstruction**

Built for educational, research, and prototyping purposes in clinical and applied vision sciences.

## üöÄ Built on NVIDIA FoundationStereo

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This project is built on top of [NVIDIA's FoundationStereo](https://github.com/NVlabs/foundation-stereo), a powerful stereo depth estimation model designed for high-fidelity 3D perception.**

We leverage FoundationStereo for its robust and generalizable depth prediction across diverse stereo inputs. All core depth functionality in this API is a wrapper around NVIDIA‚Äôs released model.

## üß† Core Features

- üîç **Stereo Depth Estimation** using NVIDIA's FoundationStereo
- üß≠ **Trajectory Tools** for analyzing eye movement or camera motion in 3D
- üß± **3D Reconstruction** from stereo pairs or sequences
- üåê **FastAPI**-based RESTful interface for easy integration with front-ends or clinical tools



Some weird torch nvidia compat stuff just run this or equivalent for you nvidia architecture once the env is active
